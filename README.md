  - Total number of links generated are counted
  - Feature to delete the link from the database

## Getting Started

### Creating a Database
  - Create a databse with any preferred name and update the databse details in [PHPScripts/config.php](https://github.com/saidixith002/URL-Shortener-Webpage/blob/main/PHPScripts/config.php)
  - Import the [url.sql](https://github.com/saidixith002/URL-Shortener-Webpage/blob/main/url.sql) file into that  database which creates the table url with all the required files and constraints.
 
### Working with the web app

  - Copy all the files from this repo to local machine ( XAMPP/php/htdocs/url ).
  - Open any browser and goto localhost/url then you can see the webapp running.
